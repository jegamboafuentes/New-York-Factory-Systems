Hi, guys, Jorge give me an update about the process of the project, he  
told me that David gives him a part of the money advance.

development process I have all my environment set up and ready.

He also told me that you already buy the license, forward me the email  
please with the license details, I'll start to work on it tonight,  
please follow the Project Manager tool (Freedcamp)[1], you can see  
there how's the progress of your app, also I need some stickers from  
you for start to test, the deliverables are in Freedcamp[1].
