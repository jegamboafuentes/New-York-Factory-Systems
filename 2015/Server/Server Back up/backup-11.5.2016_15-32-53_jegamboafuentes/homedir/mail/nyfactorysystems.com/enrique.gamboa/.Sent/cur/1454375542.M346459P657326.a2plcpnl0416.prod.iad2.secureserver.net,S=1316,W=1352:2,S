Hey Henry!

I finished my meeting with Danielle, and I think we have a misunderstanding.=
=20

Cause, she told me that we will make she's web page for free, in return to s=
he build all the content for our web page. And I'm not agree with that, beca=
use, she's web page need a calendar, and it means more hours, logic, technol=
ogy etc.=20

I'm agree to build a web page for her, if that one will just a simple web pa=
ge, but with the calendar we need to do more things, also we have to pay our=
 designer, repository, etc. it's not a good deal, because it's a little for a=
 lot. NYFS will pay more money than the content that we can get.

Can be a good deal if she pay  the things that we need for build it. But not=
 for free.

If you have time on this week we can talk about it.=20

Regards. =20
