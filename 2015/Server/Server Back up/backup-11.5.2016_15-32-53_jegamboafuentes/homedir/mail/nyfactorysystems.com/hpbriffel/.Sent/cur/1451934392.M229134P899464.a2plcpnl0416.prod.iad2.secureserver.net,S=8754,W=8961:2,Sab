Hi John - I hope you enjoyed the trip to Mexico. It was ugly here and =
you didn=E2=80=99t miss anything. I wanted to reach back to you on our =
conversation a few weeks ago.

1. You had asked for site samples:
Attached is a list of 5 pages developed with our technologies. Some of =
them have a combination of NYFS technologies; the main framework used =
for the Front-end is: Bootrsap.=20

SAMPLES:

Hyde + Hyde
http://www.hydearchitects.com/ <http://www.hydearchitects.com/>
[Architect firm]

Cozar
http://cozar.me/ <http://cozar.me/>
[Graphic design]

Plaza Classic Film Festival
http://plazaclassic.com/ <http://plazaclassic.com/>
[Film festival]

1Bite2Go

[caf=C3=A9 & deli]

Daniella Draper

Other Technologies used:

Databases:
MySQL=20
Oracle DB
Mongo DB

Back-End development:
J2EE
PHP
Node JS
Express=20
Wordpress=20

Front-End development=20
Bootstrap=20
Angular (Google)=20
HTML5
Java script=20
JQuery=20
CSS
Wordpress=20
--- and a lot of frameworks=20

Project Management tools:
Git=20
Google development tools
FTP

Definition of each topic:

Databases: Are structures for storage information, you can use it for a =
simple storage application or in a complex analytics statistics.
Back-end: Is all the logic and bounds of the system, is in the server =
and contains all the arithmetic and logic stuffs for the systems.
Front-end: Is the interface, it is the final contact with the client, it =
represent all the back-end as a simple shapes like buttons.=20
PM tools: Are the tools for know the flow and the quality of the =
project.


2. You wanted me to reach out to that publication. Is there anything I =
should stress about the situation or compromises that would achieve a =
similar result? I think the only part I am stuck on is if they can=E2=80=99=
t take it down (technically). The article has been indexed already in =
search. What I think may work, but take some time, is doing other =
coverage on you in that publication  with the correct age (which would =
be?). What is something you would be with?=20

3. Each option above alters the price slightly, but what features on the =
site are essential for any re launch? Obviously, video, customer =
submission box, CRM, etc. Anything you have to have in terms of =
functionality or user interface/design?


Please let me know if you have any questions about terminology or what =
choices we recommend.

Thanks!
