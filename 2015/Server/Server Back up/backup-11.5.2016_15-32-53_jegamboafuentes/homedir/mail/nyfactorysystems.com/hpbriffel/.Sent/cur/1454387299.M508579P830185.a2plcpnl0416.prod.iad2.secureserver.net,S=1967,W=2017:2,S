Yes I understand. Let's talk later this week. Probably the weekend. Explain t=
o her the situation about cost and tell her what costs extra like a calendar=
. It's a good deal if neither party looses. You just need to tell her the re=
asoning and show her we are all getting value. Let's talk on phone one eveni=
ng before the weekend and chat.

Thanks=20
