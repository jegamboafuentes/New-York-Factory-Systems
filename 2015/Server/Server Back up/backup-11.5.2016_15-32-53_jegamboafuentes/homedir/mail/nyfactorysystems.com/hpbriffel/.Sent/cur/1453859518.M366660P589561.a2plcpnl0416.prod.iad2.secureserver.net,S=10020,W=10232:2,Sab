Hi Sal - Sorry it took my 24 hours to get back to you. I have fighting a =
chest cold since Saturday. So the answer to your questions are:

1. The storm was fun, but my ankles have been wet since Sunday lol ;)
2. We can design the site with an area for events and photos that will =
be super easy to replace, including content, video and pics.=20
3. My opinion is that Spring events are important and the donations that =
supporters will give as a result of great marketing will be sure to pay =
for the new site.=20

I hope all is well! Keep me updated and let me know how things are =
going.=20

Thanks!
